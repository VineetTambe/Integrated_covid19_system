Initially, a real-time camera feed is taken and the image-processing and detection using OpenCV.
[] Step1- The barcode is detected and decoded using a camera.    
[] Step2- The same camera is used to detect if the person is wearing a mask or not. This is done with the help of image processing and haar-cascade to give efficient and real-time output. The system also ensures whether a person is wearing a mask or not and it captures a photo and maintains a database of the violators.    
[]Step3- An infrared temperature sensor is then used to monitor the temperature of the person without any contact and maps it to the corresponding barcode which was read. The system also gives an alert when the temperature crosses a certain threshold.    

[]Further, all the data is stored in the cloud where the analysis of every individual is carried out to understand the temperature and other patterns.    
[]The unit also houses a touchless sanitizer dispenser which can be activated by hovering the hand below it.    
[]The dashboard application is a "one-stop-shop" for the management authorities to monitor the system and gain insight
